Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Description of the given problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will project and implement PowerEnjoy, which is a car-sharing service
 that offers only electric cars.
 The price varies just depending on the real use of each individual rental
 of the car.
 The system allows clients to reserve a car via mobile or web app, using
 GPS or an address to identify client’s zone and find a car in the same
 zone.
 On the other side the mobile app allows operators to know what they must
 do.
 The system provide the functionality normally provided by car-sharing services.
 Indeed the system let the registered users to see cars location through
 the city and to reserve a car until one hour before.
 Moreover, PowerEnjoy wants to incentivize the virtuous behaviors of the
 users through discounts for those users that park in power grid station,
 charge the car and travel with more than two passengers, and penalties
 for those who leave the car with more than 80% of battery empty or far
 away from a power grid station.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system offers also a money saving option that users can enable inside
 the car, which provides information about the station where to leave the
 car to get a discount.
 This station is determined to ensure a uniform distribution of cars in
 the city and depends both on destination of the user and on the availability
 of power plugs at the selected station.

\begin_layout Itemize
[D1] All the GPS car always give the right position 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[D2] The GPS of cars cannot be switched off

 service takes care of it
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[D11] We assume that each ride has a fixed price per minute 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[D12] An user report a damage of a car if and only if the car really has

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[D13] For every maintenance services, details about the operation are correctly

\begin_layout Section
Glossary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
User: a person already registered in the system.
 A user has a profile that includes all these information: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Name 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Surname 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Number of credit card (with deadline and CVV) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Number of Driving Licence 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Operator: an employee of society.
 The system gave him references to access to their page where they find
 their assignment.
 Operator has a profile that includes this information: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Name 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Surname 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
IDNumber 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Password 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Visitors: a visitor is a person who hasn’t signed up yet.
 Visitors have less power in the system then user, they don’t have the user
 skills, and the only function they can use is to sign up and read a description
 of the service.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Passengers: a passenger is a person travelling in the car but not controlling
 it, that not need to sign in or sign up in the system.
 They had no power 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Available car: a car that isn’t reserved by another user, and it’s charge
 must be more than 50% and it isn’t plug in 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
GPS: abbreviation for global positioning system: a system that uses satellites
 (devices that move around the earth) to show the position of a person or
 thing anywhere in the world 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reservation: only users can use cars.
 One user can reserve a single car for up to one hour before they pick it
 up.
 If a car is not picked-up within one hour from the reservation, the system
 tags the car as available again, and the reservation expires.
 Now user pays a fee of 1€ 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Safe Area: it is an area where user must park cars and they don’t pay any
 fee.
 This area belongs or has a partnership with the society 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Power grid station: special areas with electricity station where people
 could park cars and recharge it 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Operator notification: is the notification that the system sends to the
 nearest operator to the car that needs the operator.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ride: it starts when the user starts the engine and ends when the user leaves
 the car in a safe area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Text assumptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We should develop a mobile application able to use its own position through
 a GPS or asking it to the client 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We assume that there is a fixed price per minute 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We assume that once the user unlock the car, he/she didn’t need to stay
 logged
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We assume that operators must stay logged during their working hours.
 Only in this way they can receive notifications from the system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We assume that for unlock a reserved car the user has to insert through
 the app, the car’s code that is unique and it’s in the front of the car
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We assume that discounts are not cumulative and if a user is entitled to
 more than only one discount, the system will calculate the highest one.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If a car is left with no more than 20% of battery we assume that an operator
 take care of it, so no one user can pick a car with more than 80% of empty
 battery
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We assume that if a car is left by some user at more than 3 km from the
 nearest power grid station, the nearest operator will move the car to a
 power grid station in order to ensure a uniform distribution of cars in
 the city.
 This wasn’t specified in the assignments but we think it’s more reasonable
 to move the car in a more popular and central area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As soon as the engine ignites, the system start charging the user, meaning
 that the system start counting the amount of money per minute that the
 external payment service has to charge to the user at the end of the ride.
 PayPal will actually charge the user when the ride is ended and the system
 notify to PayPal the final total cost of the rent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We assume that if a user couldn't pay last ride the payment society notify
 the system who block the user's account until he/she could pay
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Constrains
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Regulatory policies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system must require to clients and operators the permission to get their
 gps positions and they have to manage sensible data (position, phone number,
 credit cards information) respecting the privacy law.
 Furthermore the systems must not use notifications to send SPAM to operators
 respecting the privacy law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Hardware limitation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cars have a on-board desktop where users can see safe areas and power grid
 stations.
 Cars have also a GPS always available that cannot be remove.
 Operators and users need to have a phone with installed the respective
 mobile app; the minimum technical characteristic of the phone are a GPS
 and an internet connection.
 If users use the web app they must have a modern browser with AJAX support.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Interfaces to other applications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Our system needs to interface with the push service(s) via own APIs to send
 push notifications to operators.
 Often we need an interface for each platform: android, iOS and windows.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Our system needs also to interface with the external payment service.
 PayPal is an online payment service that allows individuals and business
 to transfer funds electronically.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Parallel operation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The server allow and support parallel operations from different clients
 and different operators.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Proposed system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Identifying stakeholders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have only one stakeholder: the government of the city who wants to improve
 pollution and traffic promoting green cars.
 We could adapt this system to other cities, just changing the safe areas
 and the power grid station because they must be modified for each different
 cities.
